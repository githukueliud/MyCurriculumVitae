# MyCurriculumVitae
This app serves to display my curriculum vitae. It has an edit button to help in editing the info as I continue to upskill.
The app uses viewmodel and navigation as the only added dependencies.
To run the app, download the source code or clone using: https://github.com/githukueliud/MyCurriculumVitae.git
Then open the source code in android studio and run and the app should open in an emulator configured within the android studio.
The app show my curriculum vitae and has the functionality to edit some of details like my name, my slack username and so on.
To enter the edit screen, click on the Floating Action Button(FAB).
After editing, click on save and the app redirects you to the Home page with the edited details displayed.
It withstands reconfigurations due to the use of the viewmodel but on re-run it displays the original content, that is, my curriculum vitae.
